# Findify Magento Integration

The Magento integration consists of two parts:
* Installing and setting up the [Magento Plugin](https://github.com/findify/findify-magento)
* Registering your account with [Findify](https://dashboard.findify.io/#/sign-in/register)

You can complete these steps indipentantly, as there's no perticular order.
