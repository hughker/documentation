# Findify Magento Integration

__Important note: you would need to install and set up [Magento Plugin](https://github.com/findify/findify-magento) to complete the integration__

To integrate Findify into your shop you'll need to follow the steps listed below:

* Select a plan and follow all the steps needed to create a Findify account.
* Configure your feed using [Magento Plugin](https://github.com/findify/findify-magento) and provide us with a valid, publicly available URL.
* Paste the link to your unique Findify Merchant.JS in the [Magento Plugin](https://github.com/findify/findify-magento) admin

## Create an account in our system

1. Go to our [Registration Page](https://dashboard.findify.io/#/sign-in/register)
2. Select _Magento_
3. Enter you name, email and store url. The store url value should not contain _https://_ or _http://_ prefix, e.g. __www.example.com__ or __exmple.com__ are both valid
4. You wil receive an email to validate your account. Click the confirmation link and proceed to next steps

## Provide more information about your shop

1. Select feed language

__This is an important step as we analyze your feed using a specific analyzer for each language  and frontend will be translated accordingly. If you don't find the language you need, conctact us at youfriends@findify.io__
2. Choose the timzone that your shop is in. This is mainly for analytics to be calculated correctly.
3. Choose the currency of your store

__We don't support multiple currencies for the same store at the moment, unless you can do the conversion on the frontend. If you need multiple currencies, you would need to have a seperate feed generated for each currency.__

## Provide a valid product feed

The product feed generation is done by the [Magento Plugin](https://github.com/findify/findify-magento). 

As soon as you install it and set it up you will have a link to the feed, which you will need to paste in the input for this step.

## Paste the link to your unique Merchant.JS

In the last step of the onboarding you will be presented with a link to your unique Findify Merchant.JS file that you will need to include in the [Magento Plugin](https://github.com/findify/findify-magento)

__Findify should be live in your store now!__
